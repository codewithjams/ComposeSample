# Compose Sample
Experimentation of screens with Jetpack Compose.

## Description
This project contains some very basic UI screens (Login for example with just barebones). While UI may be simplistic, most detail to attention has been paid on Design Pattern and Testing (Both Unit & Instrumentation).
This project is also my first exposure to [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation).
